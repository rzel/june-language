# This is as simple as it gets for June:

out.println('Hello, world!')


# And here's some extra bother just for testing:

out.print(
	'Hello, world!
	# 'done'
)
out.flush()

sayOsName(); sayOsName()



# Neither methods nor vars have to be declared before use? Every block is like a class (to some degree).

def sayOsName() {
	err.print('This is on err: ')
	err.println(getProperty('os.name'))
	err.flush()
}

var name = 'world'
# TODO out.println(name)
# TODO name = 'Tom'
# TODO out.println(name)
