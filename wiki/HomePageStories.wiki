I would like to have a simple pleasant way to show these three ways of looking at June:

  * Hi, I'm Java (in a suit). Hi, I'm June (more laid back). Hint: They're the same person.
  * June is to Scala as Groovy is to JRuby. June is Java-oriented instead of being a different system.
  * June gives you fancy features (closures, type inference, null handling, easy exceptions) without adding any runtime dependencies - unless you want to run from source. It's really just Java.
